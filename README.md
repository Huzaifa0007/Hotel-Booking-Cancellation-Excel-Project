# Hotel-Booking-Cancellation-Dashboard

<h3>What’s This About?</h3>
<p>I dove into hotel booking data from Kaggle's Hotel Booking Demand dataset to figure out what drives cancellations. The idea was simple: look at trends, guest types, and room preferences to find where hotels might be losing out—and where they can do better.</p>

<h3>Tools & What I Did</h3>
<ul>
  <li>Excel-only workflow—no fancy code here—just good ol’ spreadsheets.</li>
  <li>Cleaned the data, organized it in tables, and made pivot charts to break things down.</li>
  <li>Built an interactive dashboard (with slicers for years like 2015–2017) showing key trends.</li>
</ul>

<h3>What’s in the Data?</h3>
<p>The dataset includes bookings for both city hotels and resort hotels, covering:</p>
<ul>
  <li>When guests arrive (by month/year)</li>
  <li>Who’s booking? (couples, families, solo travelers?)</li>
  <li>Whether guests got their preferred room or not</li>
</ul>

<h3>Key Insights</h3>
<ul>
  <li>City Hotels had more bookings and more cancellations than Resorts.</li>
  <li>Couples made up the biggest chunk of both bookings and cancellations.</li>
  <li>Summer months—especially July and August—had the highest booking volumes and cancellations.</li>
  <li>Interestingly, when guests didn’t get their desired room, they canceled far less often than those who did.</li>
</ul>

<h3>How to Explore It Yourself</h3>
